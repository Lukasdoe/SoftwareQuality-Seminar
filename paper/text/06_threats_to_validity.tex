\section{Threads to Validity}

\subsubsection{External}
The examined study objects are a selection of currently available \ac{rts}-tools for the Java
programming language that may not fully represent the capabilities and problems of other existing
tools. We chose this selection of promising static and dynamic \ac{rts} solutions based on their
occurrence in other studies and software projects. The repository selection of the 100 projects 
that were scanned may also limit the generalizability of the results. For this reason, we have chosen the
repositories base on their popularity and not based on other research papers or external sources,
like it was done in previous research~\cite{ekstazimain,hyrts_paper,starts_paper}. 
% Selecting only
% repositories that use Maven for project management might have introduced a slight selection bias,
% but was necessary 

\subsubsection{Internal}
\ac{poc} repositories and automatic scan scripts may contain bugs. To mitigate this risk, we
performed tests on \ac{poc} repositories manually and multiple times to identify flaky and buggy behavior.
The code for the evaluation of scan results was written twice in different ways to eliminate logical
programming errors. We only used well maintained, popular open source libraries for the git integration
and data manipulation to reduce the risk of hidden errors in third party code.
