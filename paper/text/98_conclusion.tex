\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}

The presented evidence uncovers the alarming situation of safe \ac{rts}-tools for Java. Through a
combination of incompatibilities with new language features, methodological limitations and
implementation errors, the examined \ac{rts} solutions are
prone to act in an unsafe manner. The latest versions of the examined tools are all not safely usable in software
projects. Further research is required not to create new, supposedly safe \ac{rts}-tools that end up like our study objects,
but to update the most promising solutions and eliminate existing bugs. An up-to-date open source
implementation of safe \ac{rts} for Java will show that \ac{rts} is achievable and
has great potential for saving time and processing resources, without compromising regression test safety.
